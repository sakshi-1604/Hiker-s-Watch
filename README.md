# Hiker-s-Watch

The basic idea this app is if you're someone who loves to hike explore you can open up this app and

without tapping any buttons this is the real magic of this you just open it up and it will tell you

what your latitude longitude is how accurate the GPS is at the current moment what your current altitude

is and what the address is for the place that you are in.
